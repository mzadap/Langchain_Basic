Performance Testing Using JMeter

Introduction

Apache JMeter is an open-source tool designed for performance testing,
load testing, and stress testing web applications and various services.

Key Features

-   Supports HTTP, HTTPS, SOAP, REST, FTP, JDBC, JMS, and more.
-   Allows creating complex test plans with multiple threads and
    samplers.
-   Provides detailed performance metrics and reporting.
-   Extensible via plugins.

Components of JMeter

1.  Test Plan – The root container for all testing elements.
2.  Thread Group – Defines number of users, ramp-up, and loop count.
3.  Samplers – Represents the actual request (HTTP Request, JDBC
    Request, etc.).
4.  Listeners – Visualize and store results (View Results Tree, Summary
    Report).
5.  Timers – Add delays between requests.
6.  Assertions – Validate response content or response time.

Steps to Create a Basic Test

1.  Add a Thread Group.
2.  Add HTTP Request sampler.
3.  Configure the server details and parameters.
4.  Add a Listener like Summary Report.
5.  Run the test and analyze results.

Types of Performance Testing With JMeter

-   Load Testing
-   Stress Testing
-   Spike Testing
-   Endurance Testing
-   Scalability Testing

Best Practices

-   Use realistic test data.
-   Start with a small load and increase gradually.
-   Monitor server resources (CPU, Memory, Network).
-   Avoid running JMeter GUI for large tests—use CLI mode.
-   Use distributed testing for high-load scenarios.

Command to Run JMeter in CLI Mode

    jmeter -n -t testplan.jmx -l results.jtl -e -o /output_folder

Conclusion

JMeter is a powerful and flexible tool for conducting performance
testing and can effectively validate system behavior under various load
conditions.
